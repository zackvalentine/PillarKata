# PillarKata

To build the project and run its tests, from within the project directory, run "gradlew build" and then "gradlew test."
A test report will be generated in the project directory at reports\tests\test\index.html and can be viewed in your preferred browser.
Note that attempting to view the test report from IntelliJ can incorrectly display a "404 Not Found" page, but a browser can view the
report correctly using the correct file path.
